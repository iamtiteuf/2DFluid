The Hartmann constant, in the context of magnetohydrodynamics, is a measure that describes how a magnetic field influences the flow of an electrically conducting fluid, such as liquid metals. This constant plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of fluid flow in environments where magnetic fields are present, affecting the velocity profile of the fluid.

In a 2D simulation of the effect of the Hartmann constant within a pipe, the focus is on how the magnetic field alters the fluid flow characteristics. Typically, in the absence of a magnetic field, fluid flowing through a pipe exhibits a parabolic velocity profile, where the fluid moves fastest at the center of the pipe and slows down near the walls due to friction. However, when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the direction of flow, represented by the Hartmann constant, the velocity profile changes significantly. The magnetic field induces a force on the conducting fluid, leading to a more uniform velocity across the majority of the pipe's cross-section, except very close to the walls where viscous effects dominate. This effect is crucial in industries dealing with liquid metal cooling systems, electrometallurgical processes, and fusion reactors, among others.

The simulation would visually compare the regular flow pattern (without the influence of a magnetic field) against the altered flow pattern under the effect of the Hartmann constant. Using C++, GLFW for windowing and input handling, and ImGui for rendering the graphical user interface, users could interactively adjust the strength of the magnetic field (effectively changing the Hartmann constant) and observe how these changes affect the fluid's velocity profile within the pipe. This interactive approach not only demonstrates the theoretical concepts but also provides insights into the practical implications of magnetohydrodynamic effects in engineering applications.
